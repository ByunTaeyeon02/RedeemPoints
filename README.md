# RedeemPoints
This project was created as a way for kids that I'm tutoring to "redeem" the points they have earned. This was originally created using Java but was later switched to Dart so I can use it on my phone.

I'm still learning Dart/Flutter so the project is not a pretty and is quite buggy (This will be fix soon)
